üêû DEBUG QUEST ‚Äì AI-Powered Code Debugging Platform
Debug Quest is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, designed to help learners improve their debugging skills through hands-on practice. Unlike traditional platforms that focus on writing new code, Debug Quest presents users with buggy code snippets in languages like Python, C, and JavaScript. Users must analyze, identify, and fix these bugs, gaining real-world debugging experience across multiple difficulty levels‚Äîfrom beginner to expert.

Problem Statement
Most online coding platforms emphasize writing code from scratch but pay little attention to one of the most essential skills in software development: debugging. Beginners often struggle to understand why their code isn‚Äôt working and lack structured environments to practice fixing code. There‚Äôs a clear need for a dedicated platform that focuses on developing debugging skills, supports multiple programming languages, and adapts to the learner‚Äôs skill level through guided, interactive experiences.


üéØ Objectives
Identify the limitations of existing coding platforms that primarily focus on code creation rather than debugging and bug-fix practice.
Analyze user interaction, performance, and skill progression to provide adaptive difficulty levels and personalized problem recommendations.
Design a unified, intuitive interface where users can practice debugging code snippets in Python, C, and JavaScript across multiple difficulty levels.
Develop a responsive full-stack web application using React.js and Tailwind CSS to ensure a smooth, fast, and user-friendly debugging experience.
Implement OpenAI's GPT-based models to provide intelligent, real-time feedback, hints, and code fix suggestions.
Integrate language-specific problem sets and evaluation engines to automatically test code corrections and track accuracy.
Provide real-time code comparison features that show the difference between the original buggy code and the user's corrected version.
