Problem Statement
To analyse the lack of effective platforms for developing debugging skills among novice programmers.
Most existing tools focus on coding rather than real-world error detection and correction.
Debug Quest addresses this by offering a gamified, AI-driven environment for interactive debugging practice.
The platform adapts to individual skill levels and provides real-time suggestions to enhanceÂ learning.


Objectives
1. Identified a key learning gap among novice programmers, specifically in their ability to effectively debug and resolve errors in code.
2. Conducted research and comparative analysis of existing platforms such as HackerRank, LeetCode, and Codeforces, which revealed a lack of dedicated features for debugging practice.
3. Reviewed academic feedback and peer insights to confirm that debugging is often underrepresented in current computer science education tools.
4. Brainstormed a solution that offers an interactive, gamified, and AI-driven debugging environment to help users improve real-world coding and problem-solving skills.
5. Formulated a professional problem statement that clearly defines the existing gap and the proposed solution through the development of Bug Battle.
